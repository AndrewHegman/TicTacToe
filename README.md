# TicTacToe

The goal of this repo is to create a machine learning algorithm that will learn to play TicTacToe. 
The plan currently is to use a Genetic Algorithm to learn the weights and paremeters of a Neural Net. 
The program will be written in python and the Neural Net will be developed with Tensorflow.
